# ```python
# from collections import defaultdict
# ```
# This line imports the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. `defaultdict` is a subclass of dictionary that allows us to specify a default value for any new keys.

# ```python
# class Solution(object):
# ```
# This line defines a class named `Solution`.

# ```python
# def findWinners(self, matches):
# ```
# This line defines a method named `findWinners` within the `Solution` class. It takes `self` (the instance of the class) and `matches` as parameters.

# ```python
# """
# :type matches: List[List[int]]
# :rtype: List[List[int]]
# """
# ```
# This is a docstring that describes the input and output types of the method.

# ```python
# playerMap = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])
# ```
# This creates a `defaultdict` where any new key will have a default value of `[0, 0]`. The first 0 represents wins, the second represents losses.

# ```python
# for winner, loser in matches:
# ```
# This starts a loop that iterates over each match in the `matches` list. It unpacks each match into `winner` and `loser`.

# ```python
# playerMap[winner][0] += 1  # Increment wins
# playerMap[loser][1] += 1   # Increment losses
# ```
# These lines update the win/loss record for each player. The winner's win count is incremented, and the loser's loss count is incremented.

# ```python
# win1array = []
# lose1array = []
# ```
# These lines initialize two empty lists to store players who haven't lost any matches and players who have lost exactly one match, respectively.

# ```python
# for player, record in playerMap.items():
# ```
# This starts a loop that iterates over each player and their record in the `playerMap`.

# ```python
# if record[1] == 0:  # No losses
#     win1array.append(player)
# elif record[1] == 1:  # Exactly one loss
#     lose1array.append(player)
# ```
# These lines check each player's loss count. If it's 0, the player is added to `win1array`. If it's 1, the player is added to `lose1array`.

# ```python
# return [sorted(win1array), sorted(lose1array)]
# ```
# This line returns a list containing two sorted lists: `win1array` (players with no losses) and `lose1array` (players with exactly one loss).

# This solution efficiently processes the match data and categorizes players based on their win/loss records, returning the result in the required format.






# Yes, you can perform set operations like subtraction and addition (union) directly on sets in Python. Let's explore these operations:

# 1. Set Addition (Union):
# The addition of sets is actually called a union. It combines all unique elements from both sets.

# ```python
# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# result = set1 | set2  # Using the | operator
# # or
# result = set1.union(set2)  # Using the union() method

# print(result)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# ```

# 2. Set Subtraction (Difference):
# Set subtraction returns a new set with elements in the first set that are not in the second set.

# ```python
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
# result = set1 - set2  # Using the - operator
# # or
# result = set1.difference(set2)  # Using the difference() method

# print(result)  # Output: {1, 2}
# ```

# 3. Other Set Operations:

#    a. Intersection (elements common to both sets):
#    ```python
#    result = set1 & set2  # Using the & operator
#    # or
#    result = set1.intersection(set2)
#    ```

#    b. Symmetric Difference (elements in either set, but not both):
#    ```python
#    result = set1 ^ set2  # Using the ^ operator
#    # or
#    result = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
#    ```

# 4. In-place Operations:
# You can also modify sets in-place:

# ```python
# set1 |= set2  # In-place union
# set1 -= set2  # In-place difference
# set1 &= set2  # In-place intersection
# set1 ^= set2  # In-place symmetric difference
# ```

# 5. Multiple Set Operations:
# You can chain operations or use them with multiple sets:

# ```python
# set1 = {1, 2, 3}
# set2 = {3, 4, 5}
# set3 = {5, 6, 7}

# result = set1 | set2 | set3  # Union of three sets
# result = (set1 | set2) - set3  # Union of set1 and set2, then subtract set3
# ```

# These set operations are very efficient in Python, especially for large datasets, as they take advantage of the set's hash-based structure.

# It's worth noting that while we often say "add" sets, the correct term is "union" for combining sets. Subtraction is correctly termed as "difference" in set theory.

# Remember that sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. If order matters in your operation, you might need to consider other data structures like lists or use sorted() on the resulting set.
